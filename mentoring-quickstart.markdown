Do you want to contribute to free and open source software, but **you're not sure where to start**? 
Done some code diving recently and **wishing some feature was better documented**?
Or do you have a patch you've been meaning to work on, but you haven't found the time, or **need some feedback** on it? 

Now's the time to jump in and give back!
