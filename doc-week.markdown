## October 1 - 7, 2011

Mendicant University is pleased to announce "**Doc Week**", a concerted effort to augment and enhance Ruby MRI documentation.

Taking place during the **first week of October**, this program is targeted especially towards developers who have never (or only infrequently) contributed to OSS. We've put together a team of MU alumni who will be available to give feedback and walk you through the process of preparing and submitting a documentation patch.

**Only about 60% of Ruby is adequately documented**, so this week will offer loads of great learning and code diving opportunities, and a great chance to learn more about Ruby 1.9.3!

For the instant gratification factor, we've hooked up with Ruby core committer **Eric Hodel**, who will be setting aside some time to review and apply the submitted patches as they come in.

We are also expecting support from **Steve Klabnik**, an active contributor to the MRI documentation. Steve has written an excellent guide on **[Contributing to Ruby's Documentation](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/05/10/contributing-to-ruby-s-documentation.html)**. Go read it! It has nice step by step instructions and a screencast that will help you get a feel for how to contribute patches.

We've combed through the core and standard libraries and pulled out a **[list of code that needs documentation](mri-list.html)**, many of them suitable for beginners to contribute. Take a look, and if you see any you'd like to work on, or have some ideas of your own, **[read these instructions to participate in Doc Week](https://github.com/rmu/great-justice-hackfest/wiki/How-to-document-Ruby)**.

We'll have some office hours available for drop-in sessions during the week, if you need help getting started or want some feedback. Just drop in the #rmu channel on freenode between 14:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC Tuesday-Friday.

Or you can sign up to schedule an appointment at a time that's convenient for you. To sign up, **[open an issue on the MU mentoring github repo](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/issues)**. Make sure you include the following info:

  - your name, or how you'd like to be identified
  - your email
  - your availability for meeting (dates and times) during the week of Oct 1-7
  - if possible, a proposal or rough idea of what you'd like to document.
