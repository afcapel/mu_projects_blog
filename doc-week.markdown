## October 1 - 7, 2011

Mendicant University is pleased to announce "**[Doc Week](http://projects.rubymendicant.com/doc-week/)**", a concerted effort to augment and enhance Ruby MRI documentation.

Taking place during the **first week of October**, this program is targeted especially towards developers who have never (or only infrequently) contributed to OSS. We've put together a team of MU alumni who will be available to give feedback and walk you through the process of preparing and submitting a documentation patch.

**Only about 60% of Ruby is adequately documented**, so this week will offer loads of great learning and code diving opportunities, and a great chance to learn more about Ruby 1.9.3!

For the instant gratification factor, we've hooked up with Ruby core committer **Eric Hodel**, who will be setting aside some time to review and apply the submitted patches as they come in.

We are also expecting support from **Steve Klabnik**, an active contributor to the MRI documentation. Steve has written an excellent guide on **[Contributing to Ruby's Documentation](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/05/10/contributing-to-ruby-s-documentation.html)**. Go read it! It has nice step by step instructions and a screencast
that will help you get a feel for how to contribute patches.

Check this space in the coming days for more resources and suggestions for research.

We'll have some office hours available for drop-in sessions during the week, but you can sign up now to schedule an appointment at a time that's convenient for you.

To sign up, **[open an issue on the MU mentoring github repo](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/issues)**. Make sure you include the following info:
  
  - your name, or how you'd like to be identified
  - your email
  - your availability for meeting (dates and times) during the week of Oct 1-7
  - if possible, a proposal or rough idea of what you'd like to document.
