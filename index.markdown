We are organizing two free online events in October to put our skills to work in support of positive social change.

## [Mentoring Quickstart]({{ root-url }}/mentoring-quickstart.html)  (Oct 1 - 7)
### Improve the tools you use every day

We're opening up the Mendicant University mentoring program for anyone who wants to work on contributing back to the software that makes our lives easier.  

## [For Great Justice!!!!! Hackfest]({{ root-url }}/hackfest.html)  (Oct 21 - 23)
