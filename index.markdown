### A drive to improve Ruby documentation

We're opening up the Mendicant University mentoring program to help you contribute to Ruby MRI documentation.

## [For Great Justice!!!!! Hackfest](hackfest.html)  (Oct 21 - 23)
### Team up with organizations working for positive social change

Check out the organizations and projects you'll be working on. _Volunteer sign-up coming soon._
